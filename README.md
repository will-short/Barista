# Product Dashboard Fullstack Project

This project will take you through connecting a backend built with Express.js
and Sequelize to a React-Redux frontend by constructing CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) functionality and connecting the relevant API routes to thunks
and components.

## Getting Started

Start with the [README in the backend][backend], and once you're done with the backend,
move on to the [README in the frontend][frontend].

[backend]: ./backend/README.md
[frontend]: ./frontend/README.md
