# Product Dashboard Frontend

You will now create the Frontend for your Product Dashboard.

![Product Dashboard][dashboard-1]

## Phase 0: Getting Started

`cd` into your `frontend` directory and run `npm install`.
Then run `npm start` to confirm that your frontend runs correctly.
If it does your browser should simply say `App Component`.

### Explore the frontend application

Your frontend currently contains:

- `index.js` at the root: You will notice that `BrowserRouter` has already been
  included.
- `App.js`: This component will handle your Navigation component and your
  routing.
- `store` directory: Your store boilerplate in the `index.js` file has been
  supplied for you except for the reducer that you will add.
- `store -> products.js`: This is where you will add you `productReducer`,
  thunks and action creators.
- `Products`: This component will dispatch an action to get all of your products
  and will also list all of your products.
- `ProductDetail`: This component will describe the product as well as handle
  the delete code.
- `CreateProduct`: This component will contain a form to create a new product.
- `index.css`: Styles have been created to use in this application.

### Add a proxy

To tell your frontend server to
[proxy][proxy]
any unknown requests to your backend server in development, add a proxy field to
your `package.json`. Place the code beneath your devDependencies as shown in the
code below.

```js
  "devDependencies": {
    "redux-logger": "^3.0.6"
  },
  "proxy": "http://localhost:8080"
```

After adding the `proxy` key to your frontend's `package.json`, you'll need to
restart your frontend server by using `CTRL-C` to stop the server, and running
`npm start` to start the server again. You will now be able to make fetch calls
to your backend using a relative path.

### Phase 1: Routes

Create routes and paths for the components that have already been included.

- You want your Navigation to always render at the top of the screen.
- You want the Product component or the `CreateProduct` component to render
  based on your link choice in the Navbar.

Go to the Navigation component. Create a `ul` with 2 `li`s. Each `li` should
contain a Navlink.
The first `li` should have a `Navlink` for the url `'/'`
which leads to the `Products` component.
The second `li` should have a
`NavLink` for the url `/create` which is for the `CreateProduct` component.

Now go to your `App.js` and set up the routes for these Navlinks. Remove the
default code but leave the Fragments. Add your Navigation component to the JSX.
Beneath the Navigation component, create the routes for the `Products` and
`CreateProduct` components. Make sure the route for the `Products` component is
an exact path.

Test your links in the browser. You should now be able to click on each option
in the Navbar and see the page render the corresponding component.

### Phase 2: Store

In the `products.js` file of your store directory, create a `productReducer`
with an empty object as the `initialState`.

```js
const productReducer = (state = {}, action) => {};
```

Now go to your `index.js` file in your store and add that `productReducer`
to your `rootReducer`. It should have a key of `product`.

Test that your store is connected by going to your browser and looking in your
Redux DevTools. Choose the **State** option in the DevTools and you should see a
product key with an empty object.

![initialState][devtools-1]

## Phase 3: Fetch and Dispatch all of your Products Using a Thunk

**\*\*You might want to run your backend server in order to test routes during**
**this phase\*\***

### Store

In your store directory in the `products.js` file, create a thunk
`getAllProducts` that fetches all products using the fetch web api. It should
fetch the route`/api/products` GET route from your backend API

```js
export const getAllProducts = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/products').json();
};
```

Next, if the response objects key of ok is true, `getAllProducts` should
dispatch the products to an action creator called `addProducts`. Your thunk
should looks something like this now:

```js
export const getAllProducts = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/products').json();
  if (response.ok) dispatch(addProducts(response.products));
};
```

### Reducer

Create a `newState` variable inside your `productReducer` function before your
switch statement. The newState variable assignment should be an empty object.
Create a case in your `productReducer` for `ADD_PRODUCTS`. Each product that has
been retrieved should be stored in the newState object using normalization. The
product id should be the key and the product object should be the value.

![getAllProducts][reducer-1]

## Phase 4: Dispatch the Thunk in the Products Component using `useDispatch`

In your Products component you now want to retrieve all of the products from the
database. Import `useDispatch` from `react-redux`. After first render, dispatch
the `getAllProducts` thunk in order to fetch all of the products. This dispatch
should occur only once.

After you have dispatched, use your Redux DevTools to check the state.
You should now see all of the products that were seeded in the database.
These products are now loaded into your Redux state...but we need to use that
state in the `Product` component.

## Phase 5: Listen for Changes in state using `useSelector`

You will now use `useSelector` to listen for state changes to the products.
Import `useSelector` from `react-redux`. Using `useSelector`, create a variable
`products` that grabs the product slice of state and converts it to an array so
the you can list your products in your JSX.

```js
const products = useSelector((state) => Object.values(state.product));
```

Always test your variable to make sure you know the data type and the data you
are receiving. One way is to log the variable `products` below where you have
declared it, and take a look in your Browser DevTools console.

You can test to see if you get your array by logging your products variable
beneath the declaration.

![products-1][products-1]

## Phase 6: ProductDetail Component

You now want to list all of the products in your JSX using the `.map` array
method. You will do this by using the `ProductDetail` Component as a child that
will be nested inside the `Products` component. The `ProductDetail` component
should take the id, image, name, and price as props and render everything inside
a wrapper div like below:

![product-detail][product-detail-1]

In order for CSS stylings to be applied correctly, classNames in your project
must be identical to the ones in the images.

Now in your `Products` Component, map through your products using the
`ProductDetail` Component like below.

![products-2][products-2]

Remember that every map function must have a [key][lists-keys] for indexing.
Also, the key prop is not a prop that will be passed to the next component. If
you want that value passed you must also, separately, pass it as a prop.

### Optional Chaining

You need to account for the fact that there will be no values on the first
render. useEffect only runs after the render. Notice above how you added the `?`
after the `products` variable? You can use the [optional chaining][op-chain]
operator to conditionally render your JSX, only, if the variable has a value.
You should now be able to render all of your products using the `/` route.

## Phase 7: Create A Product

Next, you will create a product.

### Store

In `products.js` of your store directory, create a thunk, `addProduct`, that
adds a product to your database using the `POST` method on your `/api/products`
backend route. `addProduct` should take a product as an argument and send the
product to the backend using the POST method and the `/api/products` backend
route.

When the product returns you should dispatch the product to an action creator
called `addOneProduct` Add that product to the payload in the returned object of
`addOneProduct`. Use the `ADD_ONE_PRODUCT` case in your reducer to update the
state. Add a product to your already flattened state object.

![add-product][add-product-1]

The case in your reducer should look similar to the example below:

![add-product-reducer][add-product-2]

## Phase 8: Add a Form in the `CreateProduct` Component

You now want to create a form that will accept all values for your new product.
For this project your image input will accept a string which can be grabbed from
an image address on the internet.

Create a form with 3 inputs, one for image, name and price as well as a submit
button. Store the values of each input in it's own slice of component state.
Remember to create controlled inputs. Your form element should take an event
listener that runs a helper function called `handleSubmit` Create your
`handleSubmit` function. In your `handleSubmit` function create a `payload`
object based on the component state which contains the image, name and price. It
should dispatch the `addProduct` thunk from your `products.js` file in your
store with values from the payload. Finally, it should navigate, afterwards, to
the route '/' which renders all of the products. Don't forget to prevent the
browser from reloading the page in your `handleSubmit` function!

![create-product][add-product-3]

**Congratulations!** You have created a full data flow from React Component, to
Redux, to Express, to Postgres and back!

## Bonus One

Delete a product using the button in the `ProductDetail` component, Redux, and
the delete route on your backend. You should use the product id for this one.

## Bonus Two

Create an `UpdateComponent` component and code the complete data flow to update
the title and/or price of a product using it's id.
